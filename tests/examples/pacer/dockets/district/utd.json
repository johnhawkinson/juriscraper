Dft, in custody, was present with counsel. The Court advised the defendant of his constitutional right to be present if he does not disturb the proceedings by singing or any other behavior. Dft continued to sing and was ordered removed from the courtroom to another room where he was able to see and hear the proceedings. Dft's 69 Motion to Exclude Lay Witnesses was addressed. Mr. Steele asked the Court to defer ruling on the motion until the defense can respond in writing when the government's witness list is finalized. The government objected to additional briefing being filed at this late date. The Court would prefer to address the matter at this hearing but allowed the defense to submit additional briefing if it is necessary. The Court heard the arguments of counsel as to the other two motions before the Court, then took the motions under advisement.

As to Count(s) 1 and 2, Dft was found guilty by jury verdict. Dft's presence was waived by counsel for the argument portion of the hearing. The Court heard the arguments presented by Mr. Steele, Mr. Douglas and Mr. Viti as to the appropriate sentencing enhancements to be applied to the sentencing calculations. The dft, in custody, was then brought into the courtroom and seated with counsel. Victim statements were made by Mr. Ed Smart and Ms. Elizabeth Smart. Closing statement was made by Mr. Viti; the defense waived further comment. Dft, through counsel, waived his right to address the Court. The Court made its rulings on the record. The Court found that in addition to the calculations and enhancements applied in the Presentence Reprt, the enhancement for obstruction of justice applied to both counts and the enhancement for vulnerable victim applied to Count 2. The Court also found it was appropriate to apply an upward departure for extreme conduct, departing upward to total offense level 48. The Court imposed a sentence of life under the sentencing guideline range and under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3353a factors. SENTENCE: dft is committed to the custody of BOP for life. No term of Supervised Release is imposed. The dft shall give a DNA sample while in custody and shall register as a sex offender in whatever state he resides in. No fine. $200 SPA. The Court advised dft of his appeal rights. The Court will recommend that dft be placed in a federal correctional institution where he will receive the appropriate medical treatment. Attorney for Plaintiff: Felice J. Viti, AUSA; Diana Hagen, AUSA; David Backman, AUSA; Alicia Cook, SAUSA.
